# Flappy Bird on Arduino Nano with 1.3" OLED SPI Display

This project brings the classic Flappy Bird game to an Arduino Nano, displayed on a 1.3-inch OLED screen using SPI communication. The game is controlled by a single push button (normally closed type). As your score increases, the game gets more challenging with faster pipes, smaller gaps, moving obstacles, and bonus coins!

## Features

- Realistic bird graphics and animation
- Multiple moving pipes (obstacles)
- Bonus coins for extra points
- Increasing difficulty as you score higher
- Simple push button control

## Hardware Required

- Arduino Nano
- 1.3" OLED display (SPI, SH1106/SH110X compatible)
- Push button (normally closed)
- Jumper wires

## Getting Started

1. Connect the OLED display to the Arduino Nano using SPI pins as defined in the code.
2. Connect the push button to pin 2 and GND.
3. Flash the provided code to your Arduino Nano.
4. Press the button to start playing!
